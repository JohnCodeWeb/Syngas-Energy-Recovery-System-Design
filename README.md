# 1 Introduction

This project, conducted by Bilfinger Tebodin Consultants & Engineers, aims to design an electrical
installation that utilises the potential energy from the byproduct Syngas produced by a Carbon Black
manufacturing facility. The Syngas is currently being flared, causing air and noise pollution, but with
the proposed 29MWe Steam Turbine Generator (STG), it can be redirected as a usable energy source.
This report consists of an analysis phase, a research phase, an implementation phase and it ends
with the conclusions and discussion.

# 2 Analysis

## 2.1 Rationale
Bilfinger Tebodin Consultants & Engineers is an internationally operating consulting and engineering
company for the industry. Bilfinger currently employs 36.000 people, of which the Groningen branch
employs just under 100.
A customer of Tebodin produces Carbon Black for the industrial market. Carbon Black is used in the
manufacturing of various domestic and industrial products. The description of what Carbon Black is
exactly, is out of the scope of this project.
A byproduct of the manufacturing process produces a flammable gas called Syngas, which compared
to Groningen Natural Gas, has approximately 50% of the calorific energy value. The description of
what Syngas is exactly, is out of the scope of this project.
Currently, the client does not have the infrastructure to make use of the potential energy source and
thus burns (flares) this gas into the atmosphere. This flaring also causes a considerable amount of air
and noise pollution [1].

## 2.2 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design an electrical installation to harness the potential energy given
off by the syngas and redirect it into usable energy at the Carbon Black facility. This will be achieved
by making use of a proposed 29MWe Steam Turbine Generator (STG). The plausibility of this setup
will be explored, reasoned, and designed in this report.

## 2.3 Project Goals
A research goal was used to guide the project and define its goals, and it was followed by a list of
sub-questions.

### 2.3.1 Research Goal
“Design and simulate a system that harnesses the potential energy given off by the byproduct
syngas.”

### 2.3.2 Sub Questions
Therefore, to realise the research goal, the following sub questions were used to strategically orient
the design report;
a) Is the proposed STG a feasible option?
b) How do you design a fully functional system?
c) How to mathematically simulate the design?
d) How to validate the design?
